# Bridge guide

1. Introduce your planned innovation:
    a. Who are your customers?
    b. What business model do you envisage?
    c. What are the unique selling propositions (USP)?
    d. What is its potential economic and/or social impact?
2. Summarize on one slide the dataset that backs up your research results and which
makes you optimistic to be successful.
3. Explain your role in the project – why are you the right person? What are you planning
to do beyond the one-year support by BRIDGE Proof of Concept?
4. How do you plan to tackle the project?
5. What is the expected outcome of the project?

# Outline

The slide structure follows this guide: [https://pitchdeck.improvepresentation.com/what-is-a-pitch-deck](https://pitchdeck.improvepresentation.com/what-is-a-pitch-deck)

## 1 Introduction
_Who are you and why you're here? Keep it short and sweet._

* We come from the Università della Svizzera italiana
* We have experience in teaching Informatics using interactive tools
* We created ASQ to match our needs
* ASQ: slides questions answer

## 2. Team
_Show the people behind the idea and briefly describe their role._

* Vassilis Triglianos - Product Lead. My PhD work
* Cesare Pautasso - Advisor. Influenced the current product a lot, first power user, promotes it in conferences
* Vincenzo Ferme - DevOps, helped a lot with scaling the product and streamline the development and deployment process
* Antonis Garnellis - VP Product in Transifex, Sales/Marketing Advisor

## 3. Problem
_What problem are you trying to solve? Is it really a problem?_

* turn students devices in universities from distraction to learning tools
* bring active learning inside a lecture instead of only homework to increase attention, catch mistakes early and improve learning outcomes - Hard to scale!
* multi-choice questions only simple don't cut it for STEM fields

## 4. Advantages
_What makes your solution special? How are you different from others?_

* No tool that integrates presentations, complex question types and clustering for University lectures - No context switch
* Multiple question types, advanced statistics

## 5. Solution
_Describe how are you planning to solve the problem._

* ASQ: slides, questions, answers. No context switching
* 12 question types with extensible plugin system. support arbitrarily complex question types and be tailored for specific knowledge domains
* intelligent aggregation and classification of hundreds of student answers. summarization, visualization and discusssion. helps to scale active learning with large audiences
* Real-time analytics. Helps with time management of the question-answer-feedback classroom orchestration cycle
* continuous live audience understanding feedback and question moderation
* choice of the open Web platform for delivering and sharing educational content. is likely to contribute to accelerate adoption and grow a strong community of users


## 6. Product
_How does your product or service actually work? Show some examples._

<!--First bullet point. Nice! BUT: I would include tailored questions in the previous slide, or at least one if there is not time. This help a lot to let them understanding what they are using. Better if it is a question related to teaching activities, but contextualized to the audience. We can think together on this. -->
* You're using it right now.
* Authors embed questions into slides
* Presenters present course material and post question
* Students Answer
* Presenter views the results and gives feedback
<!--I would mention something about the possibility for the presenter to also use the feedback to tailor the lecture to the audience understanding, and not just passively provide content to the students that are not interested, and could probably do the same and in a much more effective way, by accessing structured online material on the same content (this is true especially for what concern computer science)-->

## 7. Traction

* table with statistics about institutions and presentations
* * 5 universities. 3 asked to use it again <!--make it clear why the other two did not ask, if it is at our advantage-->

## 8. Market
_Know, or at least attempt to predict, the size of your target market._

* Markets that need an interactive presentation tool
* Initial niche: Universities offering informatics-related degrees. in EU, approx. 620 institutions

## 9. Competition
_What are the alternative solutions to the problem you are trying to solve?_

* no Web-based interactive presentation tool offering a fully integrated experience with slides embedding complex questions
* Table of competitors
* slido, nearpod, glisser. They only support simple question types <!--make it cler why, in our experience, we know this is not good enough-->

## 10. Business model
_How are you planning to make money? Show a schedule when you expect revenues to pour in._

* Support two modes
    * Cloud software as a service delivery
        - freemium
    * on-premise installation. The on-premise option will generate licensing fees and support contracts.
* Consider additional factors:
    - the type of user (individual/institutional, presenter/viewer)
    -  the limited or unlimited number of concurrent presentations
    -  the size of the audience. 
* Additional monetization opportunities 
    -  customization
    -  whitelabeling
    -  establishing a content ecosystem marketplace, where users can share and combine reusable content artifacts (presentation slides, presentation themes, questions, question type plugins).

## 11. Investing
_What is your planned budget? What kind of money are you looking for?_

* 130,000 CHF
* Vassilis' post-doc salary;
* 50% software developer position;
* partially cover travel expenses for supporting early adopters and further promoting.
