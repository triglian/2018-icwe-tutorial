## `asq-diagram-q` question element

This element is supposed to work in ASQ presentations (https://github.com/ASQ-USI/ASQ#asq) so it does not need a set up procedure.

For an in introductive page follow the upcoming steps (it requires polymer.js):
  - open the element folder on the console,
  - type 'polymer serve',
  - go to the link displayed,
  - for a working demo click on the 'demo' button on the top-right corner of the main page.
